## Running the [CuppaServer.bat](/out/artifacts/CuppaServer_jar/CuppaServer.bat) file
The CuppaServer.bat file used to run the server uses the JAVA_HOME environment variable therefore the operating system should have java installed and the JAVA_HOME environment variable set. e.g., "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17.0.1" excluding the bin folder.
